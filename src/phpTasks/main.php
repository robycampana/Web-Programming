        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>An exercise done during my studies as I learn about Web Programming using different languages such as PHP(the newest one to my skillset). This will allow me to be able to create a website that includes some database-driven functionality.</p>
        <p>This is a simple webpage that I edit to include my content. It includes a header and footer, with a body area where you can add information for your users.</p>
